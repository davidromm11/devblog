        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there, welcome to my new website. As I begin my career, I plan on
          using this space to share projects, achievements, roadblocks, and
          thoughts. I’m not entirely sure what direction it will take, but
          that’s part of the fun. I decided to code this site from scratch
          without any previous HTML or CSS experience. It was a fun way to learn
          the basics of two new languages, while building a platform to document
          and track my growth as I learn new things. In my first post (which you
          have found yourself reading), I’ll walk you through the process of
          building the website and what I hope to do next. Thanks for checking
          it out!
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently spoke with a software developer who’s been generous with
          advice, and also has a personal blog site. During our call, he
          encouraged me to start my own, so I got to work. Since I didn’t know
          where to start, having no prior experience, I prompted AI for a
          logical roadmap from start (now) to finish (having a functional cloud
          hosted website).
        </p>
        <h2>Building the Website</h2>
        <p>
          Step one was creating a new Git repository and installing some
          recommended extensions for web development. This didn’t take very
          long, so I quickly moved on. I spent some time browsing through other
          personal tech blogs and started visualizing how I might want my site
          to look. With an idea in mind, I brought it to life by sketching up a
          highly detailed layout plan.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/images/IMG_0016.jpg"
          alt="My sketch of website plans"
          class="post_image"
        />
        <p>
          Step two was learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I took to YouTube to
          begin, and found a couple of short courses that were very informative
          and easy to follow. After a few hours, I had started to understand the
          basic structure and functions of each language. I also now had
          reference code to guide me while building my site. With a little
          experience under my belt and an eagerness to really get started, I
          started coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I focused on creating a static home page that loosely
          followed the layout I had drawn up (the sketch turned out to be a lot
          more useful than I had expected). Structuring the HTML was a lot more
          straightforward than decorating the page with CSS. I also created a
          header on this page that I planned to reuse on all pages of the site.
          There was plenty of trial and error and a little banging my head on
          the desk, but after a few more hours of work, I had a home page I was
          satisfied with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next two days, I built the remaining three pages: Contact,
          About, and All Posts. These were much easier to put together since I
          figured out you can recycle a lot of HTML code. I also started to
          appreciate just how much you can do with CSS, but before I went
          overboard on my first website, I reminded myself to keep it simple and
          clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all the pages were done, I added navigation links to make sure
          users could bounce around the website without getting stuck on a page.
          I also worked on making some of the elements interactive, like adding
          hover movement to the cards on the All Posts page. I ran into a little
          syntax trouble for some of these features, but AI helped me learn
          through it.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          At this point, I had a website I was happy with. All that needed to be
          done now was host it on a VPS (I think that’ll be the topic of my next
          post). It was refreshing to code again since I hadn’t done much of it
          after graduation. I need to do some more testing to make sure the site
          works on all devices and I might add more functionality down the road,
          but I’m content with it for now. Through this small project I learned
          a lot, not just about HTML and CSS but about planning, adapting, and
          building something from scratch, which is exactly what this site will
          be about.
